        This site presents the artistic creativity of a simple Ukrainian woman and her concept of beauty as she sees it. <br> 
        Julia Nikolaevna Vasilenko took her creative pseudonym Juniva - according to the first couple of letters of her full name. Juniva is self-taught, she took master 
     classes from various artists, but she does not have a systematic art education. He paints only by inspiration, in a good mood, and believes
      that this state is transmitted to the audience. <br><br>

    It cannot be said that Julia loved to paint since childhood. She did not have any special talents for painting, but it is interesting that 
    the only drawing that has survived since then is a red cat

<p> on a red background, painted in gouache. Definitely, cats and especially the 
    expression of their eyes is what inspires the artist to create and causes approval from her friends.<br> Juniva's creative research has several time periods. The first period of active creativity fell on 1982-1985, and the last one began
     a couple of years ago, in 2020. In the interim, only a few paintings were painted.<br><br>

    The following are three thematic albums - animals, landscapes and flowers. We suggest clicking on the album cover or the link below 
    it to view the pictures. We hope they will leave you with only pleasant impressions. <br></p>
