# Our Tiny Gallery

This site is a small art gallery of the amateur Ukrainian artist Juniva. The site introduces viewers to a short biography of Juniva, educational videos by professional artists and Juniva's paintings.  

It is a common practice that artists copy paintings by other artists. Therefore, this site, which presents paintings and educational videos, is valuable both for beginner artists and for other people who want to see, save and copy their favorite paintings. Juniva is self-taught so her example can be inspiring for all people who would like to paint but doubt their abilities.

## Features

The site consists of four pages: a main page and three pages with thematic albums:

## Existing features

### The main page image

The main page includes a photograph with the title Our Tiny Gallery and the motto "Sweet pictures to feast your eyes :)" which immediately gives the user an idea what the site is dedicated to. The photograph with the cat's eyes is a fragment of Juniva's painting and at once attracts attention of the user.

## Navigation

Navigation on the site is represented by:
- the navigation bar featured on all four pages. The navigation bar is fully responsive and consists of links Home Animals Landscapes Flowers and Contacts.
- A permanent link underline shows which page the user is currently on, while a temporary underline appears below the link the cursor hovers, making navigation easy and intuitive.

- Since each album contains many pictures, after viewing which the user will need to return to the navigation bar, it is very convenient to use the up arrow link located at the bottom of each page. This allows the user to navigate the site  easily with no need to scroll up.

## Fixed bugs

When I tested the site on the mobile phone I noticed that the columns of text are very long, and having read one column, it is uncomfortable 
to scroll up to read the second one, so I have changed the code, wrapping the text in flex-box and made it responsive to small screen sizes. Now on the smaller screens the text columns transform to rows and it is easy and pleasant to read the text. 

### Unfixed bugs
No unfixed bugs.

## Deployment

The site has been deployed to Pages on GitHub. For that I chose my project depository, went to Settings section, on the left bar chose Pages,
in the Source section chose the option Branch: main, confirmed it with clicking the button Save and on the blue field the URL appeared where my project was deployed.
