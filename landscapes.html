                    Moonlit Night on the Dnieper by Arkhip Kuindzhi (1880) astonished his contemporaries. The moonlight
                    streaming from the canvas
                    seemed so real that some of the viewers tried to look behind the picture to find a lantern or lamp
                    there.
                    But there was no lamp. And the colors were the most ordinary, not fluorescent. Just an extraordinary
                    talent of the artist.
                    Juniva was also inspired by this masterpiece, and perhaps also by the story of Harry Potter. Thus
                    was born this comic picture,

                    Yunost magazine. This story impressed the young Juniva and she painted this picture in a larger

                    childishly she tried to convey the feelings of the astronauts who returned to their native Earth
