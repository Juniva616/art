                        Moonlit Night on the Dnieper by Arkhip Kuindzhi (1880) astonished  his contemporaries. The moonlight streaming from the canvas 
                        seemed so real that some of the viewers tried to look behind the picture to find a lantern or lamp there.
                         But there was no lamp. And the colors were the most ordinary, not fluorescent. Just an extraordinary talent of the artist.
                         Juniva was also inspired by this masterpiece,  and perhaps also by the story of Harry Potter. Thus was born this comic picture,

                            The painting The Return is a copy of a painting by a Soviet artist, published in 1981 on the back cover of the
                         Yunost magazine. This story impressed the young Juniva and she painted this picture in a larger format. Clumsily,
                          childishly, she tried to convey the feelings of the astronauts who returned to their native Earth after a long flight into space. </p>
