                <p>
                    This site presents the art of a simple Ukrainian woman and her
                    concept of beauty as
                    she sees it. </p><br>

                <p> Julia Nikolaevna Vasilenko took her creative pseudonym Juniva - according to the first couple of
                    letters of her full name. Juniva is self-taught, she took master
                    classes from various artists, but she does not have a systematic art education. She paints only by
                    inspiration, in a good mood, and believes
                    that this state is transmitted to the audience.</p> <br>

                <p> It cannot be said that Julia loved to paint since childhood. She did not have any
                    special talents
                    for painting, but it is interesting that
                    the only drawing that has survived since then is a beige cat on a red background, painted in
                    gouache.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-item-right text-justify">
                <p> Definitely, cats and especially the
                    expression of their eyes is what inspires the artist to create and causes approval from her
                    friends.</p><br>

                <p> Juniva's creative search has several periods of time. The first period of active creativity
                    fell on 1981-1985, and the last one began a couple of years ago, in 2020. In the interval between
                    these periods, only a few paintings were painted.</p><br>

                <p> The following are three thematic albums - animals, landscapes and flowers. We
                    suggest clicking on
                    the album cover or the link below

                    Thanks to the Internet and YouTube, any training has become accessible. When a good artist gives
                    tutorials and shows you how
                    to paint a picture step by step, it's very easy to follow. You may not be able to draw as fast as a
                    professional artist, but
                    the main thing is the result, and it will definitely turn out good, and most importantly, a lot of
                    fun from the creative process itself!
