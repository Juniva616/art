                    This site presents the artistic creativity of a simple Ukrainian woman and her
                    concept of beauty as
                    she sees it. </p><br><br>

                <p> Julia Nikolaevna Vasilenko took her creative pseudonym Juniva - according to the first couple of
                    letters of her full name. Juniva is self-taught, she took master
                    classes from various artists, but she does not have a systematic art education. He paints only by
                    inspiration, in a good mood, and believes
                    that this state is transmitted to the audience.</p> <br><br>

                <p> It cannot be said that Julia loved to paint since childhood. She did not have any
                    special talents
                    for painting, but it is interesting that
                    the only drawing that has survived since then is a red cat on a red background, painted in gouache.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column column-right">


                <p> Definitely, cats and especially the
                    expression of their eyes is what inspires the artist to create and causes approval from her
                    friends.</p><br> <br>

                <p> Juniva's creative research has several time periods. The first period of active
                    creativity fell on 1982-1985, and the last one began
                    a couple of years ago, in 2020. In the interim, only a few paintings were painted.</p><br><br>

                <p> The following are three thematic albums - animals, landscapes and flowers. We
                    suggest clicking on
                    the album cover or the link below
                    it to view the pictures. We hope they will leave you with only pleasant impressions. <br></p>

                    Thanks to the Internet and YouTube, any training has become accessible. When a good artist gives
                    tutorials and shows you how
                    to paint a picture step by step, it's very easy to follow. You may not be able to draw as fast as a
                    professional artist, but
                    the main thing is the result, and it will definitely turn out good, and most importantly, a lot of
                    fun from the creative process itself!
