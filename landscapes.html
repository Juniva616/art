                    Moonlit Night on the Dnieper by Arkhip Kuindzhi (1880) astonished his contemporaries. The moonlight
                    streaming from the canvas
                    seemed so real that some of the viewers tried to look behind the picture to find a lantern or lamp
                    there.
                    But there was no lamp. And the colors were the most ordinary, not fluorescent. Just an extraordinary
                    talent of the artist.
                    Juniva was also inspired by this masterpiece, and perhaps also by the story of Harry Potter. Thus
                    was born this comic picture, where mice fly on brooms to the Cheese Moon. And we can only guess about their intentions.üòÅ

                <p> The painting The Return is a copy of a painting by a Soviet artist, published in 1981 on the back
                    cover of the
                    Yunost magazine. This story impressed the young Juniva and she painted this picture in a larger
                    format. Clumsily,
                    childishly she tried to convey the feelings of the astronauts who returned to their native Earth
                    after a long flight into space. </p>
