# Our Tiny Gallery

This site is a small art gallery of the amateur Ukrainian artist Juniva. The site introduces viewers to a short biography of Juniva, educational videos by professional artists and Juniva's paintings.  

It is a common practice that artists copy paintings by other artists. Therefore, this site, which presents paintings and educational videos, is valuable both for beginner artists and for other people who want to see, save and copy their favorite paintings. Juniva is self-taught so her example can be inspiring for all people who would like to paint but doubt their abilities.

## Features

The site consists of four pages: a main page and three pages with thematic albums: 
- Animals 
- Landscapes  
- Flowers.

The main page contains a short biography of the artist, covers of three albums, which are links to the corresponding pages of the site, sections with educational videos and a feedback form. At the footer of the page there are links to the artist's social media accounts.
